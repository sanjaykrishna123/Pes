                                <p class="text">*Player and Club data are frequently synchronised with real world football through Live Updates. Due to how frequently these changes occur, we suggest you check each Agent's list of available players before use.<br>*You can check the list of "Available Players" by pressing the magnifying glass icon in the bottom-left of each agent's panel.<br>*Agents that have the same name as previously available Agents may not necessarily be able to sign the same players.<br>*If you are disconnected while the player signing animation is playing, you will still obtain a player according to the pre-set odds displayed in-game. You can check which players you've signed from [Club House] > [My Team] > [Players].<br>*The pre-set odds are the same for all players for each ball colour.<br>*Numbers are shown to a second decimal point. Therefore, the total number of all the pre-set odds may exceed 100%.<br>*You may obtain duplicate players from this Agent. You may also obtain identical players to those you already own.<br>*Updates to the app or Live Update changes may affect (including increase, decrease, add or delete) the player data (player name, Overall Rating, appearance, position, stats, skills, tactics, league, team emblem, nationality/region, etc.) of players you have already signed.<br>*The popularity of players is subject to change depending on whether they were acquired before or after an update.<br>*League changes and licensing issues may result in players that you have already signed becoming unavailable in the game.<br>*Exact start and end times may be affected by maintenance.</p>
